# Usage
BrowserDownloader allows to manually download browsers for Playwright usage, in a managed way from .NET. It allows injection of a custom `HttpClient` and reports download progress via `IProgress`. It ships with the `browsers.json` file from [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/browsers.json) but can also handle a custom version file.

```csharp
var downloader = new BrowserDownloader(new MyCustomHttpClient());
await downloader.DownloadBrowserAsync(new Progress<double>(progressCallback), "chromium", "mac12");

void progressCallback(double p)
{
    Console.WriteLine("download progress: " + p);
}
```
